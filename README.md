# Local Elm

## A project exploring localisation the Elm programming experience

We want people to be able to program in Elm with some inclusion of their native language.

We are in very early stages and starting to explore translation of the error messages.

This project is inspired by the multi-lingual approach to programming pioneered by [Hedy](https://www.hedycode.com/).

If you are interested in helping out, please get in touch with @katjam on the [Elm Slack](https://elm-lang.org/community/slack) or [Elmcraft discord](https://discord.gg/H4t6xzqbZY).
